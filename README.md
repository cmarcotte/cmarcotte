- 👋 Hi, I’m @cmarcotte
- 👀 I’m interested in computational physics, pattern formation, dynamical systems, high-performance computing, computational efficiency, and frequently where these topics intersect with cardiac dynamics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on high-performance computing approaches to novel cardiac problems.
- 📫 How to reach me: at "christopher dot marcotte at durham dot ac dot uk".
